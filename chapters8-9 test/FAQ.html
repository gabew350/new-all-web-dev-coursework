    <h1>What Our Gym Is About</h1>
		<h2><a href="#">Plans</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Only about 25% of the trail is good to ride. Drop in off a shallow rock slab and then whip through a few tight berms. 
				When combined with Otero Upper, 
				this trail is just crazy fast, flowy, amazingness. 
				So be careful with your carbon frames! Most climbs are of the paved/fireroad variety, 
				most descents are a mix of loose rock, fixed rock, and good dirt.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2><a href="#">Pricing</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>For those that want to get tricksy, 
				there are jumps littered throughout the trail as well. 
				Continue pedaling up through the dark forest around small bands of shale-laden cliffs. 
				This route is worth riding MANY times. One of the best rides in all of tahoe. 
				A super fun freeride trail starting with the Pinkbike drop, an impressive 
				12' by 12' drop followed non stop features with lots of speed and perfect flow.</p>

		<h2><a href="#">Personal Training</a></h2>

			<p>
				Better yet, don't do it unless other people are pretty confident in your fitness. 
				Tree is elevated, so not rideable for most. 
				This trail is now a designated one way from the Lee's Train/C$ intersection. 
				Having gotten that out of the way, the Mana Road ride is absolutely beautiful and worth the ride. 
				The exposed rock section near the bottom is a highlight of the trail giving the exposed granite 
				slabs of Squamish a run for their money.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2><a href="#">Age Requirements</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Check yourself before you wreck yourself. 
				This is a shuttle access downhill trail that is suitable for all 
				ages and multiple different bike styles- although best suited for all mountain, dirtjumper or full on DH bikes. 
				It has a number of blind LH corners so whistle or use a bell so you can alert anyone coming the opposite way. 
				After a few bends in the trail you'll get through this section and then start hear the 
				waterfalls in another giant valley that you'll ride above. Out here you will find the most legal features including log rides, 
				jumps and rock rolls in South Tahoe including the new jumps, berms, rollers and hips TAMBA and SBTS built in 2014.
