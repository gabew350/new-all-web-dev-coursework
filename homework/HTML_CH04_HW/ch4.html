<h3>Why i love these hobbies</h3>
    <p>one of the things I remember about my childhood is watching my brothers play videogames and it rubbed off on me.
        And now I love playing videogames</p>

    <p>I love watching movies with my family, we all have a compitition on who can name a quote from a movie. 
        I wasn't very good at it when i was a kid, but now i know quotes off the top of of my head.</p>

    <p>I've been playing soccer since i could walk, i played all four years of high school. 
        I was back on defence i didn't realy like forward, 
        but during my senior night i scored the first goal even though i was supposed to be back on defence</p>
